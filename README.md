# Week1-StudentPerformance-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis Of Student Performance In Exams

## 📘 Overview
This project is part of the **NSP Nexus Internship - Week 1** task. The goal is to analyze student performance based on exam scores and understand how factors such as **gender**, **parental education**, **lunch type**, and **test preparation** impact academic outcomes.

We use Python for **data loading**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, and **insight generation**.
